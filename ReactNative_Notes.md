# Notes Scribbled for React Native

## Core Components

NOTE: Remember to import all things that needed before using
REFER HERE: [Documentations](https://reactnative.dev/docs/components-and-apis)

1. `<Text>` and `</Text>`
    - Text must be surrounded between them

2. `<View>` and `</View>`
    - container component
    - meant to hold and lay out other components
    - can have many child components in between
    - can have nested `<view>`

3. `<Button>`
    - we don't use it like above by adding caption between opening and closing tags
    - its a self-closing element
    - add title
    ```
    <Button title='Tap me!'/>
    ```
